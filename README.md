# lambda-apigw-terraform-example
The baseline of this project was to use develop terraform code to provision infrastructure in AWS.  The goal was to write terraform code to provision a new API Gateway that when gets invoked via endpoint, it calls a lambda function also provisioned to return "Hello Juwan!".
